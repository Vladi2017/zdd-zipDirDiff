NAME
	zdd - ZipDirDiff.., compare zipFile.zip	archive against test_path (sub)directory.
		
SYNOPSIS
	zdd [--nobinary|-nb] [--maxdepth k|-m k] [zipFile.zip] test_path
		
DESCRIPTION
	Both zipFile.zip and test_path must reside in the same directory. If there is no zipFile.zip parameter in the command line test_path is compared against test_path.zip file. test_path/.git subdir is not scanned by default. If two files (in the zip archive and test_path (sub)directory, including relative paths) have same size, computeCRC32 is done to establish similarity.
	Switches (OPTIONS) are in nmap-style (e.g. "$zdd -nbm 2 test_path" will not work). Use  "$zdd -nb -m 2 test_path" instead.

OPTIONS
-m k, --maxdepth k
	Comparison depth into test_path (sub)directory hierarchy, k>=0. If k=0 no test_path subdirs are searched.
-nb, --nobinary
	Ignore binaries.
-v1, --verbose1
	Also prints the common_list of files.
-v2, --verbose2
	Also prints directory and zipFile files.

EXAMPLES
	$zdd -nb -m 2 test_path		#assume there is test_path.zip archive as well
	$zdd zipFile.zip test_path

DEPENDENCIES
	Perl min. v5.14 with File::Find, Archive::Zip, List::Util modules.
