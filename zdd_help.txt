NAME
	zdd - ZipDirDiff.., compare zipFile.zip	archive against test_path (sub)directory.
		
SYNOPSIS
	zdd [--nobinary|-nb] [--maxdepth k|-m k] [zipFile.zip] test_path
		
DESCRIPTION
	This app is useful especially when you write on the same project on different machines and sometimes you need somehow to synchronize your work. zdd compare one zipped folder against his current directory counterpart (test_path). By default zdd prints founded differences in terms of dir_only files, zip_only files and altered files.
	Both zipFile.zip and test_path must reside in the same directory. If there is no zipFile.zip parameter in the command line, test_path is compared against test_path.zip file. test_path/.git subdir is not scanned by default. If two files (in the zip archive and test_path (sub)directory, including relative paths) have same size, computeCRC32 is done to establish similarity.
	For convenient the most recently altered files are "*" marked.
	Switches (OPTIONS) are in nmap-style (e.g. "$zdd -nbm 2 test_path" will not work). Please use  "$zdd -nb -m 2 test_path" instead.

OPTIONS
-m k, --maxdepth k
	Comparison depth into test_path (sub)directory hierarchy, k>=0. If k=0 no test_path subdirs are searched.
-nb, --nobinary
	Ignore binaries.
-v1, --verbose1
	Also prints the common_list of files.
-v2, --verbose2
	Also prints directory and zipFile files.

EXAMPLES
	$zdd -nb -m 2 test_path		#assume there is test_path.zip archive as well
	$zdd zipFile.zip test_path

DEPENDENCIES
	Perl min. v5.14 with File::Find, Archive::Zip, List::Util modules.
